# FAIRY TEXT
*making texts more ✨expressive✨ by sprinkling in attitude*

do you struggle to express your love to your loved ones? do you stay awake at night preparing to tell mom you love her on her birthday, but ended up just saying "happy birthday mom" because you feel anxious or awkward?

me too! so I make this app. it doesn't help with any of the things mentioned above, but it help blurs the line between joking & being serious, and maybe (just maybe) you will create your own chance of telling people you love them.

sample: 
1. mom  i 😘 love 😘 you 😍 so 😘 much  moa 😍 moa 🥰
